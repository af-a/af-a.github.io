I am a roboticist and a doctoral researcher at the [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/) as an affilitate of the [Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI (relAI)](https://zuseschoolrelai.de/).

My research interests lie mainly in the application of machine learning in robotics and particularly in biologically-inspired learning and computation. I aim to investigate whether replicating biological principles could enable significant advancements in robotic intelligence. To that end, I have recently focussed on *reinforcement learning* and *neuromorphic computing*.

I hold a B.Eng. in Mechatronic Engineering from the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.edu.my/) and a M.Sc. in Autonomous Systems from the [Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University](https://www.h-brs.de/).

My software development and systems integration expertise spans robot manipulation, navigation, computer vision, and fault detection and recovery. Over the years, I have worked on various robot platforms including the [Toyota HSR](https://robotsguide.com/robots/hsr), [Kinova Gen3](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen3-robots), [Franka Panda/FR3](https://franka.de/franka-research-3), and proprietary logistics robots at several groups: a RoboCup team ([b-it-bots](https://www.h-brs.de/en/a2s/b-it-botshome)), a Horizon 2020 consortium ([ROPOD](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/731848/reporting)), [KELO Robotics](https://www.kelo-robotics.com/), and [MIRMI](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/).
