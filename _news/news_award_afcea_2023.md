I was honoured to receive the 1st place AFCEA Bonn e.V. Studienpreis award for my Master's thesis work on vision-based neuromorphic obstacle avoidance on 25.01.2024 in Koblenz at the Koblenzer IT-Tagung 2023.

The prize is awarded to students in recognition of an excellent bachelor's or master's thesis in the fields of applied computer science, communications engineering or automation technology. Students are enominated by their professors and the work is evaluated by an independent, multi-disciplinary AFCEA commitee.

In addition, it was my great honour to be asked to deliver a talk on my work as the recipient of the 1st place award.
