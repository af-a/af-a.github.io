I had the immense pleasure of being accepted to and attending the 2024 edition of the <a href="https://robotelite.sdu.dk/">International Elite Summer School in Robotics and Entrepreneurship</a>.

The school invites 50 elite students from the field of robotics to attend technical and entrepreneurial courses within a 2-week program.

I was also honoured to be chosen as the school's ambassador from TUM for the next edition.

It was great to experience Odense and Copenhagen and to meet and collaborate with an exceptional group of peers.
