            I received the Bonn-Rhein-Sieg Sponsorship award for my Master's thesis work on vision-based neuromorphic obstacle avoidance on 20.10.2023 in Bonn, following a nomination by my supervisor and dean of the school.

            The award is granted by university sponsors and "recognizes graduates who stand out for their outstanding final thesis, but also for their very good grades throughout their studies and especially for their personality".
